# About me 
My name is Alina Głuchowska-Fedirko. In my previous education and work, the most important things were patience and precision. I am willing and ready to learn, I want to change my current life. Recently, I have been interested in topics related to quality assurance, which made me apply for the 8th edition of Tech Leaders and follow this career path.
